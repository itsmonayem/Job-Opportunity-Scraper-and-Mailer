# Job-Opportunity-Scraper-and-Mailer
Based on web scraping
This project is a web application built with Flask and Celery that allows users to schedule automated job opportunity scraping based on their skills and location preferences. The application scrapes job listings from TimesJobs and sends the relevant opportunities to the user's email address. Users can schedule the scraping task to run at specific intervals, and they can also cancel running tasks. The project utilizes SQLite as the database for storing task information and Redis for message brokering in Celery.

This project showcases proficiency in web development, task scheduling, background processing, and email integration. It demonstrates the ability to work with web frameworks, utilize external libraries, and handle asynchronous tasks effectively.
